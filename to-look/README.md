# \(Para\) Pathology Notes

This booklet will contain my notes on pathology and the tools I use for my research.

The notes may be used by medical school students, pathology residents or pathologists who have similar interests with me.

I plan to write many of the notes in English \(but some may be Turkish as well.\)

If you want to contribute to these notes, please let me know.
