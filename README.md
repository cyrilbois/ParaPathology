# Introduction

This booklet will contain my notes on pathology and the tools I use for my research.

The notes may be used by medical school students, pathology residents or pathologists who have similar interests with me.

I plan to write many of the notes in English \(but some may be Turkish or German as well.\)

If you want to contribute to these notes, please let me know.

You may also comment on paragraphs on this page or make edit suggestions (fork) via GitHub.
